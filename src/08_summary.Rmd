# Lessons Learned

## Data Processing Challenges/Gaps
 * LANDFIRE canopy biomass estimation errors, this could lead to underestimating tree level crown bulk density
    - LANDFIRE estimated bulk density values seem low for three of the sites
 * FIA Forest Type mapping errors
 * Intrinsic fuel properties currently user defined (e.g., fuel moisture, low heat of combustion, surface area to volume, etc.)
 * Requires ocular interpretation to tune trees extraction process, future work could automate starting parameters by forest type
 * Data formatting for fire modeling currently only done by TREES program
 * Surface fuels are currently assigned as either constants or as spatially formatted using the TREES program
 * Most metrics require broader validation across forest types than has been completed
 * Future linkages are possible to model tree parameters from NAIP/Satellite derived canopy height models

## Challenges with these Demos:
 * Data from USGS and Forest Service Data Archive were directly usable while other data sources lacked projection information and documented metadata
    - Only about half of the data was available in public access portals
    - About a third of the data delivered with missing metadata that initially prevented processing
 * Data interpretation/comparison is hindered by having 3-12 year gap between datasets at a site
